German Used Cars - Data Cleaning &amp; E.D.A.

In this project we will be taking a closer look at the state of Germany's used car market. My motivation for this project came not long
after I bought my own first used car and became curious about why people choose to buy new cars instead of used old ones. After a bit of searching
I came across a Kaggle dataset that contained information about Germany's used cars listings and so it sparked my interest.

For this project, we are going to be cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the said dataset in order to accumulate as much information as possible
about this market and come up with answers to various questions.

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT: In order to run the project on your own device please download the ipynb file on my repository, as well as the Kaggle
dataset that is found below in the resources. Put these two files in the same folder, rename the dataset file to 'Data - German_Used_Cars.csv'
and finally, run the notebook!
